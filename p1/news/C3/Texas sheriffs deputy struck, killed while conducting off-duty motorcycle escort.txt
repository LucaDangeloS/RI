The Harris County, Texas, Sheriff's Office on Monday said one of its officers was struck and killed overnight while conducting an off-duty motorcycle escort.
According to a Facebook post from the sheriff's office, Sgt. Ramon Gutierrez, 45, was escorting a heavy load along a service road with others. He "was off his motorcycle, blocking the exit ramp, when a female driver (40) drove around the motorcycle and struck Sgt. Gutierrez," the post said.
The office said the driver, who was exhibiting signs of intoxication, fled but was later stopped by another deputy. Multiple charges are being filed, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez told reporters Monday during a news conference.
Gutierrez was taken to a hospital and later died, HCSO said.
The driver was identified as Lavillia Spry, 40, according to an HCSO news release. Spry was arrested and charged with intoxication manslaughter, failure to stop and render aid and evading arrest.
Spry was booked into the Harris County Jail. CNN has been unable to determine whether Spry has obtained legal representation.
Gonzalez said Gutierrez served the HCSO for about 20 years. Gutierrez is survived by his wife and three children, Gonzalez said.
"There's just no words for what they are going through," Gonzalez said.
