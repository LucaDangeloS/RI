Police responding to multiple 911 calls reporting gunshot sounds Friday evening found the man "where he had crashed his vehicle into the Federal building," the Seattle Police Department said in a release.   
Officers tried to speak with the reportedly still-armed man, according to the release, and "for reasons that remain under investigation, opened fire striking the suspect."
The man died at the scene. Police have not released his identity.
