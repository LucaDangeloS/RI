"America's Funniest Home Videos," one of the shows that solidified Bob Saget as a fixture in the living rooms of many, paid tribute to its former host Sunday. 
In the tribute, current host Alfonso Ribeiro introduces the piece, which honors Saget, who died suddenly last week. 
In a press release, ABC, the network on which the clip show airs and was home to sitcom "Full House," on which Saget starred for eight seasons, called the actor "a comedy legend and the backbone of a TV show that has gone on to entertain not only America but the world."

Saget hosted "America's Funniest Home Videos" from 1989-1997. He was succeeded by Tom Bergeron.
