You're invited to Harry Styles' house!
Well, not exactly. 
The former One Direction star announced his upcoming third solo album on Wednesday, titled "Harry's House."
The artist dropped a trailer featuring himself stepping onto a stage inside an empty theater. Then Styles smiles at the camera as the set of a house is raised up behind him. 
He also posted what appears to be the album's cover art to his Instagram. 
"Harry's House" is set to release on May 20.
