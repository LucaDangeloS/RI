Rihanna and her pregnant belly may be setting a new standard for maternity fashion.
The singer and fashion mogul has been out and about in bold fashion, proving that moms-to-be can still be haute.
"It's been me personally saying, I'm not going to buy maternity clothes," Rihanna recently told Bustle. I'm not gonna buy maternity pants, jeans, dresses, or [do] whatever society told me to do before."
Her maternity style is more "rebellious" she said.
"When I saw women dress during their pregnancy [in the past], I'd think that that was the only way. So I challenged myself to push it further and really just have fun with [maternity style]," Rihanna said. "Because there's nothing more fun than a challenge for me. That's where I get creative. That's where I'm forced to come up with new ideas and new ways to make it work."
This is the first baby for Rihanna and her boyfriend, rapper A$AP Rocky, and her looks have won raves from others.
E! online reported that Kim Kardashian recently shared a photo on Instagram of a very pregnant Rihanna wearing a silver bralette with matching black leather jacket and mini skirt, sunglasses and thigh high boots captioned, "best pregnancy style ever."
