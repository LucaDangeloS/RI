Miley Cyrus was on her way to Paraguay when her flight had to make an emergency landing.
The singer posted a message Wednesday to her fans on her Instagram, telling them that the plane had been struck by lightning. The post included a video of a flash of lightning seen from one of the plane's windows.
Cyrus was headed to perform at the Asunciónico music festival.
"To my fans and everyone worried after hearing about my flight to Asunción," Cyrus wrote. "Our plane was caught in a major unexpected storm and struck by lighting. My crew, band, friends and family who were all traveling with me are safe after an emergency landing. We were unfortunately unable to fly into Paraguay. I LOVE YOU."
Cyrus posted a photo of where the plane was struck and the damage done by the lightning. 
Weather conditions were so bad in Paraguay that the first day of the festival was canceled. That means that other artists including Foo Fighters, Machine Gun Kelly and Doja Cat were unable to perform.
